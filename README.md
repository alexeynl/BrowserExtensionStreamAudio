# BrowserExtensionStreamAudio
This is browser extension to play audio stream from chinese IP cameras. I don't have the list of compatible IP cameras but if your camera audio URL contains audiostream.cgi like this

http://\<ip\>:81/audiostream.cgi?user=\<username\>&pwd=\<password\>&streamid=0&filename=

you can try this extension.

Extension only works with Mozilla Firefox (at least 110.0.1 version).
